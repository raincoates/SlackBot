# SlackBot
A python Slack-Bot with customizable commands. Used [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) as a guideline

//When importing into slack, change line 10 of starterbot.py to the Bot's user access token.

//Currently the only commands are Do, Hello, and Hi which give a text response.

//SlackGPT is for chatgpt integration of a slack bot. Still requires 3 API keys, but the bot can be added to slack channels.
